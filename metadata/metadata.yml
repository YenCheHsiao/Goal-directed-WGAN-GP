name: Goal-directed WGAN-GP by Yen-Che Hsiao
description: "The capsule contains all the codes and data I used for developing the
  Goal-directed WGAN-GP. \n\nIn the run file, it will first generate the sub-figures
  in Figure 2 in my manuscript. I used the peptides generated from the GAN we trained
  offline. This part of the code will just take these peptides and generate the figures.
  The figures are stored in the result file. The next part of the script in the run
  file will train our Goal-directed WGAN-GP with 1000epochs and generate 10000 peptide
  sequences, remove sequences with more than 2 placeholders, and calculate the immunogenicity
  using DeepImmuno CNN. The predicted immunogenicity for each peptide sequences is
  stored in deepimmuno-Goal-directed_WGAN-GP-bladder_cancer-scored_epoch1000-batch10000.txt
  under the result file. \n\nTo regenerate all the result in the paper, you can uncomment
  and run the code after line 25 in the run file. This part of the script will first
  train our Goal-directed WGAN-GP with 0,20,40,60,80,100,1000epochs and WGAN-GP with
  1000epochs. Next, it will generate the figures in Figure 2 in the manuscript except
  for calculating the binding affinity (IC50) Fig2 (d) and (e), since the binding
  affinity requires the user needs to manually copy paste the generated peptides in
  the text file and paste them on the NetMHCpan-4.1:https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan-4.1/.
  We couldn't do that automatically in this platform. I didn't run this part of the
  code because of the limitation of the runtime. It requires roughly a a day to finish
  it. If you encounter any bug in the code or have any questions, please feel free
  to contact me.\nby Yen-Che Hsiao"
